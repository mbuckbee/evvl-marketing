I WANT TO BE EVVL

- We don't recommend that you use EVVL to evaluate the responses from different models. Just open two browsers and look for yourself.

WHAT IF I UPDATE MY PROMPT?

- Ok, so admittedly you could use EVVL to store multiple prompt versions, but honestly unless you have a repitive stress injury  are you too lazy to CMD+C and CMD+V a couple times?
